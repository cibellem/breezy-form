# Breezy Form :cool:

Breezy is a reusable and fully scalable form built with React, TypeScript and Context API. <br/>
It's responsive and it renders well on a variety of devices and windows. <br/>
The form has input field validation and can be fully customized to any bussiness need. No external form validation libraries were used. </br>

## How to run it locally:

In your local machine clone the repository by running : <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/cibellem/breezy-form.git`

Install the node packages by running: <br/>
`npm run install`

Run the development server: <br/>
`npm run start`

## Future Improvements/Ideas:

Write test <br/>
Make into a npm package so it can used by myself and others in projects that require user authentication;
