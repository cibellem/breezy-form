# Breezy Form :bee:

Breezy is a reusable and fully scalable form built with React, TypeScript and Context API. <br/>
It's responsive and it renders well on a variety of devices and windows. <br/>
The form has input field validation and can be fully customized to any bussiness need. No external form validation libraries were used. </br>

## Developer Notes:

I'm very satisfied with the outcome of the form. My main goal was to build a reusable form that I can use not only to showcase my technical skills but also on my personal projects. <br/>
For simplicity I decided to stick with plain CSS. <br/>
